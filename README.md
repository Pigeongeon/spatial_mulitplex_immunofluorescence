# spatial_mulitplex_immunofluorescence


- *AKOYA_clustering_comparison_functions.R* contains the functions that I use to automate the downstream analysis of spatial multiplex immunofluorescence clustering 

- *floodfill_multiprocessing_to_color_images.py* is a script to parallelize the coloring by cell type of cell segmentation masks for images that aren't labeled during segmentation.
